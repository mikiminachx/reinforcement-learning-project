# Reinforcement Learning in Iowa Gambling Task
## Overview
<p>The purpose of this project is to predict the total money gained or lost with playing the Iowa Gambling Task. The data is trained with Deep Q-Learning (DQN) Reinforcement Learning (RL). Reinforcement learning is a particularly suitable approach for this project because it provides a framework for training intelligent agents to make sequential decisions in an environment with the aim of maximizing cumulative rewards. This framework is well-suited to situations where there is a need to learn optimal decision-making strategies through trial and error, especially in dynamic and complex environments.</p>
